# Project creation notes:
# When creating a new project, puck will copy a language-specific cheatsheet (PDF)
# from the `cheatsheet/` directory next to this script into the new project folder.
# Supported filenames (place these exact files under puck/cheatsheet/):
# - pythoncheatsheet.pdf
# - luacheatsheet.pdf
# - rustcheatsheet.pdf
# - ccheatsheet.pdf
# - cppcheatsheet.pdf
# - assemblycheatsheet.pdf

# New language support: assembly (creates src/main.asm and a Makefile using nasm/ld)
